Scilpy is closely related to :ref:`ref_dipy` it follows the same organization. But it also contains work that has been developped by our lab and that is not included yet into Dipy. Visit the `Github page <https://github.com/scilus/scilpy>`__ and the `documentation <https://scilpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scripts/modules.html>`__ for more information.

For each script, you can use the -h option for explanations on how to use it. Ex:

    .. code-block:: bash

        scil_fodf_ssst.py -h

If you don't know the name of a script, you may look for all scripts matching some keywords with:

    .. code-block:: bash

        scil_search_keywords.py keyword

Finally, for a html version of the help, you will find the description of all scripts and modules, as well as some tutorials, on `scilpy's official documentation <https://scilpy.readthedocs.io/>`_.
