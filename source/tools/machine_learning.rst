Machine Learning
================

Many students in our lab use machine learning. Most of us work closely with the VITAL lab. Similar to scilpy, their repository, vitalabAI, has a public version on Github and a private version on Bitbucket. If you are interested in machine learning, you can ask Pierre-Marc Jodoin for access.

The vitalabAI is a set of tools for machine learning, but not particularly created to use with diffusion data. If you are interested in doing machine learning with diffusion data, you can check our `dwi_ml repository <https://github.com/scil-vital/dwi_ml>`_ created specially for students both in the SCIL and the VITAL.
