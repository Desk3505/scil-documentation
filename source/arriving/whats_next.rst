What's next
===========

Now that you have set up your computer with the common SCIL setup, you are ready to take the next steps. There are probably five of them, with equal importance:

    * | **Install other tools**
      | Indeed, you have installed the bare minimum to function properly in the lab. There might be :ref:`ref_other_tools` useful to your work in the lab, like visualization tools. Ask your supervisor which tools to install among the following list:

        * :ref:`ref_mi_brain`
        * :ref:`ref_mrtrix`
        * :ref:`ref_ants`
        * :ref:`ref_fsl`
        * :ref:`ref_freesurfer`
        * :ref:`ref_dmri_explorer`
        * :ref:`ref_dicom_converters`
        * :ref:`ref_mricrogl`

      | Follow the links and see the installation steps for the tools you want.

    * | **Become familiar with the tools**
      | The Tools section is a great resource to learn more about all the tools you have installed and more. For instance, it is where you can learn about our multiple :ref:`ref_flow` like :ref:`ref_tractoflow`. Don't forget to go back to this section whenever you forget something about a tool.

    * | **Improve your knowlegde with our guides**
      | The Guides section provides additionnal information on various subjects. It is a useful resource to gather more knowlegde about :ref:`ref_git`, :ref:`ref_python`, :ref:`ref_terminal`, :ref:`ref_bash` or :ref:`ref_anat`, to name a few important ones.

    * | **Start reading about your project**
      | In parallel to all of that, your supervisor will probably give you lots of reading to do. Whenever you come across a concept you don't understand, don't hesitate to reach out in the lab and seek help. You will most certainly find someone who can explain the concept to you.

    * | **Get to know the people in the lab**
      | Our lab has a nice social vibe, so don't hesitate to talk to people outside of "work". It always makes for a better experience! You can also have a look at the `team <https://scil.usherbrooke.ca/pages/team/>`__ on the SCIL `website <https://scil.usherbrooke.ca/>`__.
