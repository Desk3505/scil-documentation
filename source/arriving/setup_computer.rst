Setting up your computer
========================

Before you can start working with the tools commonly-used or developped in the lab, you need to setup your computer. Follow this step-by-step guide to get your computer ready to work.

*This section is a work in progress. Eventually, it should cover OS choices, IDE choice, python and virtualenv installation, scilpy installation, nextflow and singularity/docker.*

We recommend using linux, but Mac can be an option. With Windows, your life will definitely be more complicated.

1. First, you should work in a virtual environment to avoid breaking your python installation. See the :ref:`ref_venvs`.

2. Install scilpy (see the :ref:`ref_scilpy` page). This will install Dipy too.

3. You may want to install Tractoflow (see :ref:`ref_tractoflow`) or our other tools (see :ref:`ref_other_pipelines`).

4. You may want to install other tools that are often useful for people in our lab (see the :doc:`here <../intro_to/explore_software>` page for MI-brain, Ants, MRtrix, FSL and Freesurfer, etc.) 

Getting set up on super computers

The first use of a computing platform can be tricky but you'll get used to it. Please see the (:ref:`ref_heavy_computing`) tab for more information and for our first-use tutorial. If your goal is to use the computing platform to run Tractoflow, you will find instructions on the :ref:`ref_tractoflow` page. Else see the :ref:`ref_other_pipelines` page.
