Discover the brain anatomy
==========================

Most of us did not study in biology or anatomy. We come from physics, computer science, mathematics. But you'll probably learn many bundles' names and position, just by seeing pictures. Here are some pictures of the bundles most commonly used in the lab.


Lobes, sulcus, gyri and more

A few famous bundles
********************

*Anatomical description*: Description of famous bundles can be found in atlas descriptions in the literature, ex `here, Radwan et al (2022) <An atlas of white matter anatomy, its variability, and reproducibility based on constrained spherical deconvolution of diffusion MRI>`_.

*Atlas bundles as reference*: Below, we show pictures of reference bundles taken from Recobundles' reference bundles (here, the ones that were used when processing the `Tractoinferno <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01833-1>`_ database). They are in MNI space.

*Bundles recovered through tractography*: To see an example of bundles recovered in a real subject, see the :ref:`ref_recobundles` page.

*Simulated bundles*: You can also discover similar bundles associated with the phantom from the `ISMRM 2015 Tractography Challenge <https://tractometer.org/ismrm2015/home/>`_. The differences between these simulated bundles and real anatomical ones were discussed in `Renauld et al, 2023 <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-28560-w>`_. In this case, the bundles are not entirely simulated; they were created by tracking from real subjects with deterministic, bundle-wise parameters. However, the dwi accompanying the data is entirely simulated.

**Comissural fibers**: They connect the two hemispheres of the brain. They are mostly in a left-right orientation.

    - AC: Anterior comissure
    - CC: Corpus callosum
    - PC: Posterior comissure
    - FX: Fornix

**Projection fibers**: They connect the cortex with lower parts of the brain or with the spinal cord. They are mostly in a z orientation (top-bottom).

    - FPT: Frontopontine Tract
    - IFOF: Inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus
    - ILF: Inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus
    - MCP: Middle cerebellar peduncle
    - MdLF: Middle longitudinal fascicle
    - OR, or OR_ML: Optic radiation (with Meyer's loop)
    - POPT: Parieto-occipital pontine tract
    - PYT: Pyramidal tract
    - SCP: Superior cerebellar peduncle
    - SLF: Superior longitudinal fasciculus
    - UF: Uncinate fasciculus


**Association fibers**: They connect two cortex regions in a same hemisphere.
    - AF: Arcuate fasciculus.
    - CG: Cingulum.
    - FAT: Frontal aslant tract
    - ICP: Inferior cerebellar peduncle


The corpus callosum is probably the easiest bundle to recognize from a raw diffusion / tensor / fODF image because of its strong anisotropy. It is a good choice of bundle to assess that the data was read correctly during processing.

It is often divided into sub-sections during automatic segmentation, because it is a very large bundle covering most of the brain. Below, we can see that when zooming in the frontal section of the CC, near the mid-hemisphere, the FA is a bright white (strong anisotropy), and the tensors' main peak show a clear shape of "U".
